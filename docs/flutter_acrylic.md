## Notes

### Windows

**No additional setup is required.**

On Windows 11 versions higher than or equal to 22523, `DwmSetWindowAttribute` API is used for `WindowEffect.acrylic`, `WindowEffect.mica` & `WindowEffect.tabbed` effects.

This plugin uses the undocumented `SetWindowCompositionAttribute` API from `user32.dll` on Windows 10 & early Windows 11 versions to achieve the acrylic effect.
Learn more at [Rafael Rivera](https://github.com/riverar)'s amazing blog post about this [here](https://withinrafael.com/2015/07/08/adding-the-aero-glass-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps).

[ONLY on Windows 10] In most cases, you might wanna render custom window frame because the blur effect might leak outside the window boundary.
You can use [bitsdojo_window](https://github.com/bitsdojo/bitsdojo_window) to make a custom window for your Flutter application.

`WindowEffect.acrylic` causes lag on window drag in Windows 10, this issue is fixed by Microsoft in Windows 11. This issue can be prevented by a "hack", however nothing has been done within the plugin to circumvent this on Windows 10.

`WindowEffect.mica` & `WindowEffect.tabbed` only works on Windows 11.

You can see the [example](https://github.com/alexmercerind/flutter_acrylic/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart) application for further details.

### macOS

**Additional setup for macOS:**

Open the `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` folder of your project using Xcode, press ⇧ + ⌘ + O and search for `MainFlutterWindow.swift`.

Insert `import flutter_acrylic` at the top of the file.
Then, replace the code above the `super.awakeFromNib()`-line with the following code:

```swift
let windowFrame = self.frame
let blurryContainerViewController = BlurryContainerViewController()
self.contentViewController = blurryContainerViewController
self.setFrame(windowFrame, display: true)

/* Initialize the flutter_acrylic plugin */
MainFlutterWindowManipulator.start(mainFlutterWindow: self)

RegisterGeneratedPlugins(registry: blurryContainerViewController.flutterViewController)
```

Assuming you're starting with the default configuration, the finished code should look something like this:

```diff
import Cocoa
import FlutterMacOS
+import flutter_acrylic

class MainFlutterWindow: NSWindow {
  override func awakeFromNib() {
-   let flutterViewController = FlutterViewController.init()
-   let windowFrame = self.frame
-   self.contentViewController = flutterViewController
-   self.setFrame(windowFrame, display: true)

-   RegisterGeneratedPlugins(registry: flutterViewController)

+   let windowFrame = self.frame
+   let blurryContainerViewController = BlurryContainerViewController()
+   self.contentViewController = blurryContainerViewController
+   self.setFrame(windowFrame, display: true)

+   /* Initialize the flutter_acrylic plugin */
+   MainFlutterWindowManipulator.start(mainFlutterWindow: self)

+   RegisterGeneratedPlugins(registry: blurryContainerViewController.flutterViewController)

    super.awakeFromNib()
  }
}
```

Now press ⇧ + ⌘ + O once more and search for `Runner.xcodeproj`. Go to `info` > `Deployment Target` and set the `macOS Deployment Target` to `10.11` or above.

Depending on your use case, you may want to extend the area of the window that Flutter can draw to to the entire window, such that you are able to draw onto the window's title bar as well (for example when you're only trying to make the sidebar transparent while the rest of the window is meant to stay opaque).

To do so, enable the full-size content view with the following Dart code:

```dart
Window.makeTitlebarTransparent();
Window.enableFullSizeContentView();
```

When you decide to do this, it is recommended to wrap your application (or parts of it) in a `TitlebarSafeArea` widget as follows:

```dart
TitlebarSafeArea(
  child: YourApp(),
)
```

This ensures that your app is not covered by the window's title bar.

### Linux

**Additional setup for Linux:**

Find `my_application.cc` inside the `linux` directory of your Flutter project & remove following lines from it.

```cpp
gtk_widget_show(GTK_WIDGET(window));
```

```cpp
gtk_widget_show(GTK_WIDGET(view));
```

**Adding blur to the Window.**

Since current Flutter embedder on Linux uses GTK 3.0, so there is no official API available for backdrop blur of the window.

However, some desktop environments like KDE Plasma (with KWin compositor) have some third party scripts like [kwin-forceblur](https://github.com/esjeon/kwin-forceblur) from [Eon S. Jeon](https://github.com/esjeon), which allow to add blur to GTK 3.0 windows aswell (when the window is transparent, which you can certainly achieve using the plugin). Thus, this setup can be used to obtain result as shown in the picture.

Blur on Linux is more dependent on the compositor, some compositors like compiz or wayfire also seem to support blur effects.
